Design a class to find the kth largest element in a stream. Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.

Your KthLargest class will have a constructor which accepts an integer k and an integer array nums, which contains initial elements from the stream. For each call to the method KthLargest.add, return the element representing the kth largest element in the stream.
